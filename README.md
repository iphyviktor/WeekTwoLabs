# WeekTwoLabs
This lab is a solution to the problems given by the C# tutor:

Write a c# program to check prime number. 
Input: 17 
Output: prime number 
Input: 57 
Output: not prime number
************************************
Given two numbers, return true if the sum of both numbers is less than 100. Otherwise return false.
lessThan100(22, 15) ➞ true // 22 + 15 = 37
lessThan100(83, 34) ➞ false // 83 + 34 = 117
lessThan100(3, 77) ➞ true
*******************************************
There is an operator in c#, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.
Example:
remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1
*******************************************

I have combined all solutions to the three problems in one (Program.cs file).
